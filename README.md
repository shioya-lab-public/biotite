# riscv2llvm

A binary translator that translates RISC-V to LLVM IR.

## Requirements

- RISC-V Linux ABI and system calls
- Little-endian statically-linked executable files
- Arch: RV64GC, ABI: LP64D

all CSR are ignored
all rm are ignored
fmv only sect result int val
fclass is not supported

## Testing Commands

``` Bash
llvm-objdump -fhtDz test
```

## RISC-V Notes

- The base integer instruction sets use a twoâ€™s-complement representation for signed integer values.
- The program counter `pc` holds the address of the current instruction
- Except for the 5-bit immediates used in CSR instructions (Chapter 9), immediates are always sign-extended
- The shift amount held in the lower 5 bits
- The target of `JALR` address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit I-immediate to the register rs1, then setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero.
- In RV64I, only the low 6 bits of rs2 are considered for the shift amount
- Unlike RISC-V, taking the remainder of a division by zero in LLVM is undefined behavior.
- All CSR instructions atomically read-modify-write a single CSR

CSR
- If rd=x0, then CSRRW shall not read the CSR and shall not cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read.
- For both CSRRS and CSRRC, if rs1=x0, then the instruction will not write to the CSR at all, and so shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write.
- Both CSRRS and CSRRC always read the addressed CSR and cause any read side effects regardless of rs1 and rd fields.
-  For CSRRSI and CSRRCI, if the uimm[4:0] field is zero, then these instructions will not write to the CSR, and shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write. For CSRRWI, if rd=x0, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read. Both CSRRSI and CSRRCI will always read the CSR and cause any read side effects regardless of rd and rs1 fields.

Counter
- RDCYCLE: The execution environment should provide a means to determine the current rate (cycles/second) at which the cycle counter is incrementing.
- RDTIME: The execution environment should provide a means of determining the period of the real-time counter (seconds/tick). The environment should provide a means to determine the accuracy of the clock.

## syscall

The Linux system call number is different for each architecture.
    - `SYS_write` in spike pk is 64, but in x64 is 1.
    - <https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/RISC-V-Linux/blob/master/riscv-pk/pk/syscall.h>
    - <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/refs/heads/main/constants/syscalls.md>
To call a generic `syscall` in LLVM IR, we must recover the type for each argument, possibly with some other processing, in each system call.
