# riscv2llvm

A binary translator that translates RISC-V to LLVM IR.

## Requirements

- RISC-V Linux ABI and system calls
- Little-endian statically-linked executable files
- Arch: RV64GC, ABI: LP64D

all CSR are ignored
all rm are ignored
fmv only sect result int val
fclass is not supported
mprotect always return 0, because it fails for legal input in RISC-V
readlinkat will change the return value to -22 if its -1, as RISC-V seems to require this particular value

## Testing Commands

``` Bash
llvm-objdump -fhtDz --mattr=a,c,d,f,m test
llvm-objdump -sj.tdata test
clang -static test.ll -lm
```

We need to use RISC-V GCC objdump to dump the `.tdata` section, so we can properly initialize the `PT_TLS` segment of the `AT_PHDR` entry in `auxv`. Also, we need static linking in the host to make `PT_TLS` available in `AT_PHDR`.



## RISC-V Notes

- The base integer instruction sets use a twoâ€™s-complement representation for signed integer values.
- The program counter `pc` holds the address of the current instruction
- Except for the 5-bit immediates used in CSR instructions (Chapter 9), immediates are always sign-extended
- The shift amount held in the lower 5 bits
- The target of `JALR` address is obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit I-immediate to the register rs1, then setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero.
- In RV64I, only the low 6 bits of rs2 are considered for the shift amount
- Unlike RISC-V, taking the remainder of a division by zero in LLVM is undefined behavior.
- All CSR instructions atomically read-modify-write a single CSR

CSR
- If rd=x0, then CSRRW shall not read the CSR and shall not cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read.
- For both CSRRS and CSRRC, if rs1=x0, then the instruction will not write to the CSR at all, and so shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write.
- Both CSRRS and CSRRC always read the addressed CSR and cause any read side effects regardless of rs1 and rd fields.
-  For CSRRSI and CSRRCI, if the uimm[4:0] field is zero, then these instructions will not write to the CSR, and shall not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write. For CSRRWI, if rd=x0, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read. Both CSRRSI and CSRRCI will always read the CSR and cause any read side effects regardless of rd and rs1 fields.

Counter
- RDCYCLE: The execution environment should provide a means to determine the current rate (cycles/second) at which the cycle counter is incrementing.
- RDTIME: The execution environment should provide a means of determining the period of the real-time counter (seconds/tick). The environment should provide a means to determine the accuracy of the clock.
